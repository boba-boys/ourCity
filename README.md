# Our City

Welcome to Our City!

Our City is a mobile, React Native, social networking application. It uses google places APIs to render and drop markers between groups of connected users on a shared map generated by google maps.

Users can add a new location, create a group of your closest friends, discuss the quality of a venue, restaraunt, park, or any other location your heart desires!

To create a marker, a user simply taps on the screen near where they think the location is, and search. The search bar uses google places autocomplete api to return a list of search results from google maps.

A user can then select the desired place/location from the list of search results. Once the user finds the desired location, they can create the marker. The marker will be shared with the rest of the group and serve as a shared review board of the location, where users can comment and share experiences.
